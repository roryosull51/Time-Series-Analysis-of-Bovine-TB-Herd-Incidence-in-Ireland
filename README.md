# Time-Series-Analysis-of-Bovine-TB-Herd-Incidence-in-Ireland

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the incidence of TB in cattle herds across Ireland using time series analysis. The goal is to forecast future TB incidence rates using historical data and ARIMA modeling techniques.

## Files
- `data/TBincidence.csv`: The dataset containing historical TB incidence data, sourced from the CSO.
- `scripts/TBcode.R`: The R script used for data preprocessing, ARIMA modelin and forecasting.
- `outputs/TBreport.pdf`: A detailed report summarising the methodology, results and conclusions.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/roryosull51/Time-Series-Analysis-of-Bovine-TB-Herd-Incidence-in-Ireland.git
   ```
2. Open the `TBcode.R` script in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
3. Ensure the `TBincidence.csv` file is in the `data/` folder.
4. Run the script to reproduce the analysis and generate forecasts.

## Results
- Achieved accurate forecasts by optimizing SARIMA model parameters.
- Validated the model by evaluating fit and residuals.
- Detailed findings are available in the `TBreport.pdf` file.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Time series analysis
- ARIMA modeling
- Data preprocessing and visualisation
- Statistical analysis
